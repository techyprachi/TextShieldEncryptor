‚ú® Key Features
Multiple Encryption Algorithms:

AES (Advanced Encryption Standard): For robust and fast symmetric encryption.

DES (Data Encryption Standard): Included for educational and historical context.

RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman): For secure asymmetric encryption using public and private key pairs.

Dynamic & Interactive UI: A modern, cyber-themed interface that's easy to use.

Live Animated Background: A "Matrix" style digital rain effect made with HTML Canvas.

On-the-Fly RSA Key Generation: Instantly generate a new public/private key pair for RSA encryption.

Responsive Design: Works smoothly on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Front-End: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6)

Styling: Tailwind CSS

Cryptography Libraries:

CryptoJS for AES & DES.

JSEncrypt for RSA.

Hosting: Netlify

üöÄ How to Use
Open the Live Demo: https://textshield-encryptor.netlify.app

Select an Algorithm: Choose between AES, DES, or RSA from the dropdown menu.

Provide a Key:

For AES/DES, enter a secret password.

For RSA, use the "Generate New Key Pair" button or paste your own keys.

Enter Your Text: Type or paste the message you want to encrypt or decrypt in the "INPUT DATA" box.

Click Encrypt/Decrypt:

To Encrypt, use the public key (for RSA) or secret key (for AES/DES).

To Decrypt, use the private key (for RSA) or the same secret key (for AES/DES).

The result will appear in the "OUTPUT DATA" box.
